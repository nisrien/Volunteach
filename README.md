# Volunteach🧑‍🏫

Hello and welcome! Volunteach is my first hands on coding project, designed as a Java GUI application for managing volunteer enrollments in educational programs located in rural areas throughout Indonesia. It demonstrates my early experiences with Java, database connectivity using JDBC, and GUI development in NetBeans.  

## Features  
- User-friendly Java GUI for managing volunteer data.  
- Uses CRUD to manipulate data in a MySQL database.  
- Uses `AbsoluteLayout` and other NetBeans-specific libraries for the interface.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** NetBeans  
- **Database:** MySQL, phpmyadmin  
- **Libraries:**  
  - JDBC Connector (`mysql-connector-java`)  
  - `AbsoluteLayout`  

## Requirements  
To run this project, you need the following:  
1. **NetBeans IDE** installed.  
2. **MySQL Database** server:  
3. The required libraries (`AbsoluteLayout` and JDBC) added to your project classpath.  

> **Note:** Currently, the database schema is not included. There will be future updates, which will provide a complete SQL script to set up the database.  

## How to Run  
1. **Clone this repository:**  
git clone https://github.com/nisrien/Volunteach.git  
2. Open the project in **NetBeans IDE**
3. Ensure the configuration set up with your operating system and database configuration


## Future Updates
Database Schema: A complete SQL script to set up the database will be added
